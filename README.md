So far not much has been achieved for my google friday. I have been lacking when it came to paying attation to it because of my time trying to focus the main homework/ other class work as well.

What my orignal idea/concept for this fridays goal was to setup a time management system for students to use based upon importance of grade and the amount of homework that the student has and  the amount of time the student has as well. I attempted the idea, but ultimatly it resulted into failure from a time organization view point. It would organize the users importance level based on a chart made from 1 to 10, one being the most difficult and ten being easy and then it would organize what you should do first. That part worked. I talked to Mr.Gold about my project and he discouraged me from countinuing on with the project. He said that it was too easy and was rather not impressive compared to other projects he has been shown in the past. He told me that I should go for something harder and he recommended me to make a alarm like code that discouraged me from playing video games. 

The program he would want me to make I believe would be easy, but im confused on how you would make a alarm if the putty program is not runninng 24/7. That would be one challange, another would be the amount of time given to work on the homework. I would be able to use arounnd 10 hours to do this code, but thats asking me to do atleast 2 hours of code for 5 days a week. That is easy, but the commitment level would be queastioned really quickly.
